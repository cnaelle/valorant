Customizable REST API that lets you build headless ecommerce without limits powered by WooCommerce.

== Description ==

**Important**

Updates for the CoCart plugin on WordPress.org starting on **5th October 2022** will not be getting any further major updates for a long while in order to focus on the paid CoCart Pro version of the plugin. Only minor fixes for bugs will be updated. Don't worry, you'll still be able to use this plugin forever.

Also while API v1 can still be used it will no longer be supported.

### CoCart: The #1 ecommerce RESTful API built for WooCommerce that scales for headless development.

Take your **WooCommerce** business to the next level with **headless ecommerce** using CoCart.

[CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart)'s customizable REST API for WooCommerce allows you to separate your CMS from your presentation layer, while developers can use the frameworks and tools they love.

## ü•™ The API

CoCart provides support for managing the user session, alternative options for doing this task do exist; however, their usage can be limited to applications of the same origin as the WordPress installation. This is due to WooCommerce using cookies to store user session tokens.

CoCart provides the utilities to change this behavior during any cart request and passes the required information to HTTP Header so it can be cached client-side. The use of an HTTP Authorization header is optional allowing users to shop as a guest.

#### üõí Cart API

Add **simple, variable** and **grouped products** to the cart by **product ID** or **SKU ID**, update cart items individually or in bulk and more. The flow is simple and returns an updated cart response every time with all the totals calculated and stock checks done for you making it easier to simply update your **UX/UI**.

#### üõçÔ∏è Products API

Access products from your store to display how you like including a number of queries to help you filter by product categories, tags, attributes and more. You can even get posted reviews all without the need to authenticate. All the information you need about a product and it's conditions to help you with your UX/UI development is all provided ready for you.

#### ‚ûï Extras

* Get store information.
* Login the customer/user.
* Logout the customer/user.
* Empty the cart.

As an added bonus for administrators, CoCart also provides the capabilities to:

* Get Carts in Session.
* Get details of a cart in session.
* View items added in a cart in session.
* Delete a Cart in Session.

## ‚ú® Features

CoCart also provides built in features to:

* **NEW**: Override the price for simple or variable products added to cart.
* **NEW**: Attach customers email address while adding an item to the cart. **Useful for abandoned cart situations.**
* Load a cart in session via the web. **Useful if you don't have a headless checkout and want to use the native checkout.**
* Supports **guest customers**.
* Supports **basic authentication** including the use of email as the username.
* Support [authentication via WooCommerce's method](https://cocart.dev/authenticating-with-woocommerce-heres-how-you-can-do-it/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).
* Supports multi-site network.
* Does **NOT Cache** the API so responses are **fresh** every time.
* Works across multiple domains, CORS ready! **So you can have multiple frontends connected to one backend.**
* Allows you to filter CoCart to be white-labelled.

Included with these features are **over 100+ [filters](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#filters)** and **[action hooks](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#hooks)** for developers to customize API responses or change how CoCart operates with our extensive documentation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is CoCart free? =

Yes! CoCart‚Äôs core features are absolutely free. [CoCart Pro completes the full cart experience!](https://cocart.xyz/pro/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart)

= How do I start using CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce installed with the REST API enabled. Then install CoCart and follow the documentation.

> Please check the requirements listed in the [installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation) section.

= Who should use CoCart? =

CoCart is perfect for ecommerce owners and developers who want to create an ecommerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin provides a REST API built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it. [Checkout the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) to get some understanding.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

You can find the documentation for CoCart on the [CoCart REST API Docs](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

= Can I change the layout format/add/change details to the responses? =

You certainly can. There are over 100+ filters available to do just that. [Checkout the tweaks plugin](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart-tweaks) to view or maybe use the examples provided. [View the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) for more.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler in the first place? =

If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler? A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

- The default session handler only supports cookies.
- The default session handler only saves changes at the end of the request in the `shutdown` hook.
- The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.
- The default session handler **does not support guest customers**.
- The default session handler **does not store additional data that maybe required to help you**.
- More consistent with modern web.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session table in the database? =

The default WooCommerce session table only stores the basics of a cart in session. CoCart provides additional data that maybe required to help you and other add-ons/extensions developed by CoCart or third-parties.

Such as when the cart was created. This information is only stored in the browser session.

Also the source of the cart it was last saved. For the web it will be `WooCommerce` and for your headless ecommerce `CoCart`. This lets you know which version of your store your customers are shopping from should you have both web and app versions.

= Can I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless ecommerce on another domain? =

Yes of course. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with [the CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or you can [manually enable it via the filters in the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers).

= Can I add "WooCommerce Subscriptions" product to the cart? =

Absolutely you can. Any WooCommerce Subscriptions product can be added to the cart the same way a simple or variable product is added to the cart.

= Why can I not add the same item to the cart with a different price? =

Each item added to the cart is assigned a cart item key which is made of four key values: **Product ID**, **Variation ID**, **Variation attributes** and **Cart item data**.

The price and quantity is not taken into account to make this key.

So if you add the same item to the cart but with a different price, the cart will look up the cart item key to see if it's already added to the cart before deciding to either:
    1. Add it as a new item.
    2. Update the quantity of the previous item, in your case the price.

= Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

Not at this time. "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" ignores any REST API from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar except for WooCommerce Blocks and JetPack. However, [TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/) plugin is supported.

= Is "TaxJar for WooCommerce" plugin supported? =

If you have "[TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/)" v3.2.5 or above and CoCart v3.0 or above installed... then yes, it is supported.

= Is CoCart right for my business? =

CoCart‚Äôs REST API makes it possible for businesses to build a complete custom storefront. It‚Äôs API-first, enabling your business to take the shopping experience to the next level.

Made by and for developers, CoCart immediately allows you to create sophisticated experiences fast with unlimited possibilities.

With our extensive documentation and resources available, CoCart is a plug and play solution that works out of the box.

Save yourself 80% of a headache and hours of development time.

= Can I use any modern stack? =

Yes you can use your preferred tools and favorite modern technologies like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) and more giving you endless flexibility and customization.

= Why CoCart and not WooCommerce Store API? =

Both API‚Äôs are unique for their individual purposes.

WooCommerce's Store API is designed for their [Gutenberg blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/) which only requires a fixed format and is still prone to be used on native storefronts.

It also only works with *Nonces* when you are on the site so for mobile apps or headless ecommerce, you will run into issues. It is also missing a lot of valuable information that developers require to help them.

CoCart's API is designed for decoupling away from WordPress and lets you build headless ecommerce using your favorite technologies. **No Nonces, no cookies.**

CoCart is packed full of powerful features that are completely customizable making it possible for businesses to build a complete custom storefront how they want.

No matter the type of store you are running, CoCart helps you grow.

It‚Äôs made by and for developers and immediately allows you to create sophisticated experiences fast with unlimited possibilities with it‚Äôs plug and play solution that just works out of the box.

So even if you are new to building a headless ecommerce or already have a WooCommerce store and been wanting to go headless, nows the time to start.

Don't take my word for it. Checkout the testimonials left by startups, freelancers, agencies and many more.

= Do you have a JavaScript Library? =

Yes we do. You can [find it here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cocart/cocart-rest-api). It doesn't require authentication for guest customers. It supports CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript Modules (ESM). Requests are made with [Axios library](https://github.com/axios/axios) with [support to promises](https://github.com/axios/axios#promises).

= Can I install/update CoCart via Composer? =

Yes. The best method would be to install/update CoCart from the GitHub repository but you can also do so via [https://wpackagist.org/](https://wpackagist.org/search?q=cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce&type=plugin)

= Does CoCart work for multi-site network? =

Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it via the network and all sites will have CoCart enabled.

= Can I enable white labelling for CoCart? =

Yes you can. You will have to edit your `wp-config.php` file to add a new constant. [Details can be found in the documentation](https://cocart.dev/articles/wp-config-php/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart#white-labelling).

This minor release is related to Yoast SEO support.

### Tweaks

* Unlocked a change made in **v3.4.0** by un-registering the rest field `yoast_head` for the Products API.

Originally it was to keep the JSON response valid because a bug at the time was causing the response to not return correctly. It was also to increase the performance of the response as Yoast SEO returns the same data twice just in a different format. Now the issue appears to be gone and recent feedback suggested this should be left on by default.

Other improvements for supporting third party plugins are in the works.

If you want to discuss supporting a third party plugin, [start a discussion](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/discussions) on the CoCart GitHub repository.

* Tested: ‚úîÔ∏è Compatible with WooCommerce v6.6

= v3.7.1 - 13th June, 2022 =

Example of limiting products via category and tag. `wp-json/cocart/v2/products/?category=accessories&tag=hats`

> There was some confusion with this as the documentation said (query by ID) but the API schema said (query by slug). Now you can do either. This adjustment affects both API versions.

= v3.7.0 - 31st May, 2022 =

### What's New

* Tested: ‚úîÔ∏è Compatible with WooCommerce v6.5
* Tested: ‚úîÔ∏è Compatible with WordPress v6.0

= v3.6.3 - 11th May, 2022 =

**üî• This is a HOTFIX!**

### Bug Fix

* Undone change made to `cocart_prepare_money_response()` function. Another WC extension using the filter `cocart_cart_item_price` confused me and was overriding the format returned.

> This reverts partially back to v3.6.1

= v3.6.2 - 10th May, 2022 =

### Improvements

* Improved `cocart_prepare_money_response()` function. Cleans up string values better.
* Additional decimals gone for item price.

### Tweaks

* Item price and subtotal now returns correct money response.

= v3.6.1 - 6th May, 2022 =

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed calling `update_plugin_suggestions()` function the non-static method. For WordPress Dashboard > Plugins > Add New.
* Fixed undefined `$variations` for `get_variations()` function. For Products API v2 thanks to [@jnz31](https://github.com/jnz31)
* Improved `get_connected_products()` function to validate product ID's before returning. For Products API v2. Solves [[issue #336](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/336)]

= v3.6.0 - 24th April, 2022 =

### What's New?

* Added support to prevent CoCart from being cached with [WP Super Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/) plugin.
* Added support to prevent CoCart from being cached with specific web hosts like [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/docs/cache-control).

### For Developers

* Introduced new filter `cocart_send_cache_control_patterns` that allows you to control which routes will not be cached in the browser.

= v3.5.0 - 21st April, 2022 =

### What's New?

* Improved: Plugin suggestions now fetches data from a JSON file and is cached once a week.

* Tested: ‚úîÔ∏è Compatible with WooCommerce v6.4

### Bug Fix

* Fixed Products API v2 Schema for Images.

> Related to a change made in v3.2.0

= v3.4.1 - 4th April, 2022 =

### Bug Fix

* Fixed: An uncaught undefined function `add_meta_query` which allows you to query products by meta. Thanks to [@jnz31](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/uncaught-error-call-to-undefined-method-cocart_products_v2_controlleradd_meta/) for reporting the error.

> Dev note: I'm an idiot for not finding this issue sooner. The function `add_meta_query` was not committed when the products API add-on was merged with the core of CoCart. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Please accept my apologies for the issue caused. üôè

### Deprecated & Replacement

* Deprecated use of `wc_get_min_max_price_meta_query` function. Although it was *deprecated* in WooCommerce since **v3.6** there was never a replacement provided and it was still working. Now the function has just been copied into a new function `cocart_get_min_max_price_meta_query` and will no longer provide the debug warning. It can be improved in the future if needed.

= v3.4.0 - 28th March, 2022 =

### What's New?

* Tweak: Unregistered rest field `yoast_head` from the Products API to keep the JSON response valid and increase performance.

> The rest field `yoast_head_json` still remains.

= v3.3.0 - 24th March, 2022 =

### What's New?

* Enhancement: Appends the cart query (Load Cart from Session) to the checkout URL so when a user proceeds to the native checkout page from the native cart, it forces to load that same cart. - **Guest Customers ONLY**

> This was added due to some circumstances the cart failed to load then after on the checkout page via normal means.

### Tweaks

All custom headers introduced by CoCart with `X-` prefixes (no longer a recommended practice) now have a replacement. Please use the new headers listed below instead.

> üì¢ All current `X-` prefixed headers will be removed in a future release of CoCart.

| Previous Header        | New Header           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| X-CoCart-API           | CoCart-API-Cart-Key  |
| X-CoCart-API-Timestamp | CoCart-Timestamp     |
| X-CoCart-API-Version   | CoCart-Version       |

### For Developers

* Introduced new filter `cocart_use_cookie_monster` to prevent destroying a previous guest cart and cookie before loading a new one via Load Cart from Session. Thanks to [Alberto Abruzzo](https://github.com/AlbertoAbruzzo) for contributing further feedback.

> Dev note: Helps should you find the web browser is displaying the "Cookie was rejected because it is already expired." in the console log and the cart did not load again on refresh despite the session still being valid.

= v3.2.0 - 17th March, 2022 =

### What's New?

* Enhancement: Moved products array to it's own object and returned pagination information in the response. - **Products API v2 ONLY!**
* Tested: ‚úîÔ∏è Compatible with WooCommerce v6.3

> Dev note: A small break but a good one thanks to the feedback from **[Alberto Abruzzo](https://profiles.wordpress.org/albertoabruzzo/)**. This only affects when accessing all products with or without arguments set. Just need to access the array of products from an object not just from the response. What's also great about this enhancement is that any arguments set will also be appended to the pagination links making it easy for developers.

### Bug Fix

* Fixed: Plugin review notice reappearing even after it has been dismissed.

### Deprecated

* Support for WooCommerce less than version 4.8 or legacy versions of WooCommerce Admin before it was packaged with the core of WooCommerce.

### Enhancements

* Better detection of WooCommerce Admin. Now checks if the feature is enabled.

### For Developers

* Introduced new filter `cocart_prevent_wc_admin_note_created` to prevent WooCommerce Admin notes from being created.

= v3.1.2 - 10th March, 2022 =

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an Undefined index: Items for shipping packages in the cart response. Caused the JSON response to not return valid even if the response status was `200`.
* Fixed a fatal error. Uncaught Error: Class `CoCart_Session_Handler` when cron job runs in the background.
* Fixed Yoda conditions.
* Removed calculating totals once cart has been loaded from session as it caused the cart not to show.

### Tweaks

* Added more translation notes to clarify meaning of placeholders.

= v3.1.1 - 2nd March, 2022 =

**üî• This is a HOTFIX!**

### Bug Fix

* When updating an individual item in cart, the product data is not passed when validating the quantity and was causing a fatal error. [[issue #319](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/319)]

> Developer note: This is because an improvement was made when adding items to the cart using the same function that is used to validate the quantity and I forgot to update the parameters for when it's used to update an item. My bad.

### What's New?
